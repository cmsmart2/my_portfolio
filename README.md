# my_portfolio


My basic portfolio of web work with links.

In this assignment, I created a digital portfolio of my web development work.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

The portfolio fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with HTML, bootstrap, and CSS, the assignment also showcases my web development work created for other Boot Camp assignments.
